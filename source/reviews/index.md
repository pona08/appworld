#### What is TBH
tbh is short for "to be honest," the app takes an unconventional approach to anonymity. While it allows friends to anonymously communicate, it only allows users to exchange compliments, which are sent via in-app quizzes. 

tbh is an app for giving anonymous positive feedback to friends.  want people to share their honest opinions about their friends.

We built tbh because we believe that social networks should make us feel better about ourselves‚Äînot worse.

Only available on iOS.  The team is working on Android.

### Questions:
‚ÄúBest to bring to a party?‚Äù ‚ÄúTheir perseverance is admirable?‚Äù ‚ÄúCould see becoming a poet?‚Äù

### Why TBH is popular
‚ÄúOur goals for anonymity are much different than most apps [that emphasize] the ability to say things without repercussions,‚Äù the tbh team explains. ‚ÄúThis is more about the ability to tell people more of the things that make them happy. One is more targeted toward harassment while ours is more targeted towards making people better off.‚Äù


Meanwhile, the ‚ÄúTo Be Honest‚Äù fad had blown up with teens on Instagram. Users would offer to send ‚ÄúTBH‚Äù compliments to people who Liked or commented on their photos. During the tumultuous and sensitive age of adolescence, kids were showing how eager they were for a dose of positivity.

Uniting the team‚Äôs philosophy with this trend, tbh was born. ‚ÄúWe shipped it to one school in Georgia. Forty percent of the school downloaded it the first day. The next day it was in three more schools, and then the next day it was in 300 schools,‚Äù the team recounts. That‚Äôs even more impressive because tbh doesn‚Äôt spam your contacts with unexpected invite messages. ‚ÄúUser trust is really important,‚Äù the team declares.

Following in the footsteps of Facebook, tbh wasn‚Äôt launched publicly. At first it was locked down to just a few states. That was to keep it from crashing as Midnight Labs scaled up the infrastructure. But also because tbh only works if lots of friends are on it. Throttling the rollout keeps demand pent-up so when tbh launches somewhere new, like New York state this week, it becomes the talk of classrooms and teens download it in droves.

Secret imploded due to bullying. Yik Yak‚Äôs anonymity meant there was little locking people into the app. tbh will have to marry the freedom of expression that comes when your name isn‚Äôt attached with a sense of community that keeps kids committed.

It launched at a single high school in Georgia (TBH doesn‚Äôt require you to be in school, but they knew it would work best for teens), and after three days, students at 3,000 schools across Georgia and beyond were using TBH.

There‚Äôs a built-in incentive for a user to share the app, too. If you answer a certain number of questions in a row, you get timed out (like Candy Crush). If you want to keep going, you can wait an hour or invite more friends.



### History of TBH

tbh was launched on August 3rd, 2017 in the State of Georgia.

tbh was built by a small team of developers and designers in California.
‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre improving the mental health of millions of teens, that‚Äôs a success to us,‚Äù says Nikita Bier, co-founder of tbh.  

tbh might have only taken two weeks to build, but the team had to fail for seven years first. Bier started Midnight Labs back in 2010, eventually raising a seed round from a few investors, including social app guru Josh Elman at Greylock. Midnight Labs built a personal finance app, a work time tracker, a college chat app, a personality test. ‚ÄúWe probably built 15 products,‚Äù the team tells TechCrunch.

Nothing quite flourished, but the five-person team purposefully kept its burn rate low to maximize its runway and get more chances to experiment. ‚ÄúWe never spent money in any ways that would be considered lavish.‚Äù But after years of trial and error, ‚ÄúWe were running towards the end of our runway. We only had maybe 60 days left.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when Midnight Labs got philosophical. ‚ÄúThe big milestone of the last social apps was the ability for open discourse [like on] Twitter. That was a great achievement‚Äù the team explains. ‚ÄúWe think the next milestone is thinking about social platforms in terms of love and positivity. We think that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been missing from social products since the inception of the internet.‚Äù

A small company called Midnight Labs in Oakland, CA. According to the company representative I spoke with (who requested to remain anonymous because the company is a sort of egalitarian collective without any one person as its face or name), Midnight Labs had spent five years making social apps that were mostly failures, and they were almost out of money. Then this summer, they had a moment of clarity ‚Äì they wanted to make something that would make people feel good.


### How to play TBH

The app, which is aimed at middle schoolers and high schoolers, connects to your address book so you can find people you know. It serves up a series of "polls" about your friends. The questions change but they are all positive, asking you to choose the "world's best party planner," or who is "too lit to be legit."

The app keeps identities a secret, but users can see some details about who's picked them (e.g. "a girl in the tenth grade"). It's also borrowed some of the addictive dynamics of free-to-play games, though it doesn't use in-app purchases at the moment.

If someone "chooses" you in a poll, you earn "gems," which you can use to unlock more features within the app. You can only complete a set number of polls at a time and when you run out, you need to wait for a timer before you can take on more. 


tbh creates fun, uplifting polls about your friends, like:

‚ÄùWho is most likely to be president?‚Äù
‚ÄúBest person to go on a roadtrip with.‚Äù
"Too lit to be legit."
The person picked will received a notification each time they are chosen. Although the notification doesn't contain your name, it does include your grade and gender, along with who the other choices were.

Getting started:
Signing up is easy. You can download the app from the App Store here.

Why are my contacts in polls? How do I remove them?

Until you have 4 friends, we use your contacts as placeholders in the polls so you can still play the game. However, your contact names will always be hidden in poll responses sent to friends.

We care deeply about your privacy and will never share personal information to other users.

How do I join my school?

When you signup, pick your school and grade. If you skip this step, you can add your school by going to your profile and tapping EDIT. You‚Äôll be able to search for your school from there. At this time, we only support high schools, colleges, and universities.


Add friend:
There are a three ways to add friends:

Via your phone contacts
Via friends username
Via friends-of-friends
By joining your school network

The only way to invite friends is by tapping INVITE next to their name in the Add Friends screen.

Advanced:
Can I create my own polls?

You can submit polls by swiping to Settings and tapping Submit a poll. We review them every night and if it's funny or interesting, you'll see it on the app in 48 hours.

Remember, all polls must be:

Appropriate for ages 13 and up
Uplifting
Not offensive to any group

Awards & leaderboard:
üíé Gems are awarded to you each time you get picked in a poll. The gem is pink if a girl picks you, blue if a boy picks you and purple if a non-gender person picks you. They keep track of how many times you've been chosen on tbh. You can use them to unlock questions and other features in the future.

Are my gems visible to my friends?

There are two areas where users can see your gems:

Your Top 3 Gems are on your profiles. However, you can always hide them by tapping EDIT, and then flipping the switch that says "Hide my gemlist".

Your recent gems are shown in the newsfeed. However, you can also hide gems from the feed by tapping the üîí icon in the bottom left corner.



Can not direct message within the app.

How to find out who send the tbh?
For now, we recommend posting on Snapchat or Instagram to see if the sender will reveal themselves.

I don't want to receive invitations to tbh.

tbh only sends invitations if a user deliberately taps INVITE on your name.

The best way to stop invitations is to ask the sender to stop inviting you to apps in the future. Alternatively, you can always reply NOPE to any text message and they will no longer be sent to that number.


Why did my inbox disappear?

Your inbox resets every few days so it doesn‚Äôt get cluttered. Don‚Äôt worry though, you still retain all your gems in your gem list but they would be located on your Profile.

Why do I need a phone number and contacts?

tbh uses your phone number and contacts to identify you, find your friends, and let your friends find you. Your phone number is never shared with other users.

I put in my wrong school/grade/name. What do I do?

We only allow one school, grade or name change per account. If a change was made in error, you can contact us by tapping GET HELP in the app and explaining the situation.

My school is not listed‚Äîhow do I join it?

The tbh high school & college list is mostly complete but from time-to-time we miss one. Please contact us at tbhtime@gmail.com with the name of the school and its city.

What grades or ages is tbh designed for?

To protect the privacy of younger people, we only support Grades 9 and above. Users under 13 years old should not use or download tbh.
